OS  = Tells you about the system !!

Full Form of OS = Operating System !

What is OS ? 
Is it a software / hardware ? ---software

Software? set of programs
Program = set of instructions

Two types of S/w  = System S/W  , Application S/W

System S/W ? S/W to manage the h/w system 
Example - OS , linker , loader, compiler, interpreters, device drivers

Application S/W ?    Programs to solve user problems
Example - add.c , calc.cpp , MS office, browsers, Media players, games

What does OS do ?
	1. INTERFACING
		a. OS is an interface between end-user and system
			( CLI  or GUI  )
		b. OS is an interface between application-program and system
			( system calls ) 


	2.  PROCESS MANAGEMENT
	3.  MEMORY MANAGEMENT
	4.  IO/DEVICE   MANAGEMENT
	5.  AUTHORIZATION /AUTHENTICATION ( SECURITY )
______________________________________

What is the System ?
	System consists of 
		1. Processor -- Execute/Run the instructions
		2. Storage --- store the programs
		3. IO device --- Interact with the external world 


	 Assume that you have written and compiled add.c ---> add.exe

	Where  is add.exe stored ? 
	Secondary Storage  = HDD or SSD 
	   HDD -  Set of Discs ( Platter )  made up of "Al"
		  coated with "Fe" ( magnetic material ) - magnetic dipole 

	   Non Volatile Storage = Stored data is retained after POWER OFF
		Access time is very slow 
		Size = 1Tb ( 1000 gb huge size )


________________________________
	Primary Storage = RAM = Volatile Memory = Primary Memory = Memory
	Main memory  = the data is NOT retained after POWER OFF 
		Access time is much faster than HDD
		Size = 8 gb or 16gb

______________________________________
	Cache = L1 cache , L2 cache 
		FLIP-FLOPS 
		Small size / Volatile  / Access time is very fast 


_______________________________________
	Processor ---

	  main 
	   printf enter num   }  IO 
	   scanf %d %d , &x,&y } IO
	   sum = x + y  }  CPU
	   printf sum  } IO 


Two types of Instructions in any program  ---  
1. CPU instructions  = Arithmetic Instructions ( + -  *  / % ) 
		       Logical Instructions (  && || !  )
		       Relational Instructions (  <  > <= >= !=  == )
2. IO instructions = printf , scanf , cout , cin , fwrite , fread 

	Processor 
	1. CPU  =  execute CPU instructions
	2. DMA / IO co processor  = Direct Memory Access =  execute IO instructions

______________________________________

	CPU  --- ALU  + registers 
		
	ALU  = Arithmetic and Logical Unit  = Semiconductor circuit  
		the circuits can execute Arithmetic logical and relational instr

	Registers =   Very fast access storage 
		      size v.v.v. small ( WORD size =  32bit/64bit /128bit)
			

		1. IR  = HOLDS one instruction at a time = Instruction register
		2. PC =  Holds the Offset address of next instruction 
				Program Counter
		3. DR0, DR1 = Data Registers = Holds the Operands of the operation
		4. Accumulator  =  HOld the result of the instruction


______________________________ 
	IO  Devices 

	Input Device = Data flows from input device to RAM ( via DMA )
	Keyboard , mouse, scanner, mic , joystic , PD , CD , biometric scanner 
	retina , finger , barcode scanner , rfid 


	Output Device = console, speaker ,printer, projector , ......
	Data Flows from RAM  to Output Device ( via DMA )

	LAB  ---  
		OS  --- Linux based OS  ( ubuntu / Cent OS  )

		CLI 
	1. connect to the server  192.168.100.56  using putty.exe
	2. get your login and password and enter
	3. change appearance
	4. press enter many times and see the PROMPT  
	5. type a command  -  clear  
	6. type a command  - pwd  }  it will show present working directory 

  TOPMOST folder   =  /   ( forward Slash ) 
	7.  go to topmost directory  =  cd = change directory
		cd /
	8.  again pwd 
	9. see the contents of topmost folder 
			ls  = list contents
	10  . go to each folder in topmost folder using cd  >>  cd  bin 
		see the contents using ls 
		 go back to topmost folder using cd /
